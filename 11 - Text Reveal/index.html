          <p>
            Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the
            first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modern
            invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation
            does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of
            space. We mean to be a part of it–we mean to lead it. For the eyes
            of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets
            beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a
            hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We
            have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass
            destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.

            We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
            not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that
            goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and
            skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,
            one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

          <h2>That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.</h2>
          <p>
            Mankind is drawn to the heavens for the same reason we were once
            drawn into unknown lands and across the open sea. We choose to
            explore space because doing so improves our lives, and lifts our
            national spirit. So let us continue the journey.
